security weakness from 1	fixing

weak passwords(plaintext)	password hashing + salting
XSRF				session management
error messages			turn off in glass fish

Input validation:
Each parameter passed to the Websitegets validated before they are processed. Evenparameters which are added by the user manually and are normally not procesed get validated to prevent reflected xss.
We use a Whitelist. (security_functions whitelist)

Password management:
The password are stored salted as md5hash in the database

session management:
User session:
Session id is created in this way: md5(Username+Timestamp+Randonnumber). Randonnnumber is generated by a PRNG. 
Session ID and Username get stored on the client in a cookie.
In database Session ID and IP of lat request is stored. at each request on the user frontend Session ID and IP has to be the same, otherwise the request is not processed.
Cookie/Session expires automatically after 30 minutes.

Admin session:
all admin functionality is at one page. a get parameter chooses which functionality is wanted, the admin login parameter are sended at each request.

Data base user fixing:
Used the principle of the least privelege, so we created a database user lutdb, which have only rw rights on the lut database. (This prevents reading from information scheme etc)

Turn off error messages:
there have to be a function in glassfish to turn off the error messages.
